Description:
This project was carried out to develop my skills as a frontend, under the Platzi Master program.

It was done in using the React library, with a configuration reset using webpack.

It is configured to be able to enter from mobile phones in the local network using the server's ip.

Instructions:

npm i:
install project dependencies

npm run dev:
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localIpAdress:9000 to view it in the browser.

npm run build:
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
